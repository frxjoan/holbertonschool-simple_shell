.TH HSH 1 "January 2026" "Holberton School" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter inspired by the standard
shell. It reads commands from standard input and executes them.

The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

.SH USAGE
When launched without arguments, the shell displays a prompt and waits
for user input.

Example:
.PP
.nf
$ ./hsh
$ ls
$ /bin/ls
$ env
$ exit
.fi

.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive mode
When standard input is a terminal, the shell displays a prompt
and waits for commands.

.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
When input is piped into the shell, commands are read and executed
without displaying a prompt.

Example:
.PP
.nf
echo "ls" | ./hsh
.fi

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell executes commands using the following logic:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the command contains a slash (/), it is treated as a direct path.
.IP \[bu]
Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the directories
listed in the PATH environment variable.
.IP \[bu]
The shell checks that the file exists, is not a directory,
and has execute permissions before execution.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
Errors are printed using the following format:
.PP
.nf
shell_name: line_number: command: error_message
.fi

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the following exit statuses:
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.TP
.B 126
Permission denied or command is a directory.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.
.TP
.B 128 + signal
Command terminated by a signal.

On end-of-file (Ctrl+D), the shell exits with the status of the last
executed command.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B PATH
A list of directories separated by colons used to locate executables.

.SH LIMITATIONS
The shell does not support:
.IP \[bu] 2
Command separators (;)
.IP \[bu]
